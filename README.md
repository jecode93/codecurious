## Where code questions get answered

Welcome to my personal coding dictionary! This blog is where I document answers to my software engineering questions. Whenever I forget a concept, need clarity on a term, or want to revisit a lesson, I turn here. It is ideal for anyone who wants a go-to guide for solving coding problems and understanding key concepts.
