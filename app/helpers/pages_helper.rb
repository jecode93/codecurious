          description: "When I first started coding, I had more questions than answers.
Sometimes I would solve a problem — but a few weeks later, I’d forget how I did it!
I created CodeCurious to document what I learn, reflect on the process, and share it with others who might be on the same journey.
It’s a space to keep track of lessons, celebrate growth, and stay endlessly curious."

          description: "I’m a self-taught software developer who believes that curiosity is a superpower.
I love clean code, building meaningful projects, and helping others find their way in tech.
When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring new ideas, drinking coffee, or getting inspired by great books and podcasts."

          title: "My Philosophy ✨",
          description: "I believe learning to code is not just about syntax or frameworks —
it’s about thinking differently, embracing mistakes, and staying curious even when things get tough.
Every question matters. Every bug is a chance to learn.
At CodeCurious, progress — not perfection — is the real goal.
That doesn't mean lowering standards — it means celebrating real growth, step by step.
It's about building real skills through practice, reflection, and persistence, not waiting for perfect results."
